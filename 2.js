/*
The  core ideal Event Driven & Non Blocking I/O:

Ryan built Node.js using:-
> Google's V8 Engine (the same engin that powers Chrome).
> libuv (a C library for asynchronous I/O).

This combination allowed Node.js to:
> handel many requests at once using a singel thread 
> Avoid blocking while waiting for tasks like file reading or database queries.

In short : 
Node.js interoduced a single-threaded, event-driven architecture that made servers lightweight and fast.
