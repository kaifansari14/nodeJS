        Rise in Popularity (2012-2015)
Node.js rapidly became the go-to choice for building:

> APIs 
> Real-time applications (chat,live update).
> Command-line tools 
> Developer utilities

Big companies joined:

> Netflix (for streaming)
> Paypal (for faster APIs)
> eBay, Walmart and NASA adopted Node.js in production.
However, around 2014, there was community tension -- development was slow and contributors were frustrated.
