// The Beginning 2009, Ryan Dahl's Vision 
/*
In 2009, a software named ryan Dahl from the U.S. created Node.js.  
At that time: 

• javaScript was only used in browsers.
• Servers wear build using PHP,Python, or Java. 
• Each request on the server would create a new thread. consuming memory and slowing things down under heavy load.
 
 Ryan found this inefficient, espeacially after seeing how web browsers handled asynchronous events (from blocking operators). 

 He wanted the same non-blocking behaviour in the server.
that's how NodeJS was born - to bring JavaScript to the backend but in a faster and more scalable way.
